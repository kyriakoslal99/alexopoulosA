Identifying and combating VAT fraud before it occurs is therefore important for welfare. This paper proposes flexible machine learning algorithms which detect fraudulent transactions by utilising the information provided by the VAT network structure. It does so by recognising that VAT fraud is a group or community activity which has to be detected by relying on heterogeneous data of huge dimension. VAT fraud detection is implemented through a combination of a suitably constructed Laplacian matrix with classification algorithms that rely on scalable machine learning techniques.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Networks and machine learning to detect Value Added Tax fraud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelos Alexopoulos","Petros Dellaportas","Michalis Titsias"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1680307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680307200,"objectID":"1039d79466b5e49224919fd6c7430b99","permalink":"https://alexopoulosA.github.io/publication/variance_reduction/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/variance_reduction/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Variance reduction for Metropolis-Hastings samplers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelos Alexopoulos","Petros Dellaportas","Omiros Papaspiliopoulos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"63b5d853305cd4deb2c702d979f3f123","permalink":"https://alexopoulosA.github.io/publication/jumps/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jumps/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian prediction of jumps in large panels of time series data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelos Alexopoulos","Leonardo Bottolo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"3d408bb7fbee04fc187f81b45ff0468a","permalink":"https://alexopoulosA.github.io/publication/bvs_copula/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bvs_copula/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Variable Selection for Gaussian copula regression models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelos Alexopoulos","Petros Dellaportas","Jonathan J.
